# GIPHY
This assignment was probably the easiest of the entire course. We were introduce to GIFs and were tasked with creating a page that users could select a topic or search for a topic and the site would display the ten most popular GIFs that resided on the GIPHY site. You could click on the gif for it to run and click again to make it stop. SInce I love video games that was my obvious choice. I designed the site and created a search bar and buttons for five games I chose as test cases. You would click on the button to display the GIFs. Then you would click on the gif to run thema nd click again to freeze them. You would put your own input to the search bar and click search and i twould find the ten most relevant gifs for what you entered and display those. It used the GIPHY API and an ajax call to get the GIPHYS and display them and then used play and freeze functions for the GIFs. 
Tools used; Ajax, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript.
